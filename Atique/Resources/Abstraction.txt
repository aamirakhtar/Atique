Abstraction:-
Its a concept or idea.

1-When you dont Bother about the functionality:-
a-Abstraction is something in which you suppose to bother about the real functionality, and leave the concered
party to bother about that.

eg:-
Coffee maker:-
Coffee maker provides you simple interface to make a coffee and you dont suppose to 
bother about the real functionality of the coffee maker.

eg:-
Drive functionality provides you simple interface to drive any car but the real functionality can be very complex
and hidden from you. and you dont suppose to bother about that.

eg:-
Facebook commenting:-
Commenting functionality provides you simple interface to just select post and write a comment in the comment section.
where as the real functionality is hidden from you and you dont suppose to bother that, facebook will be bothered about that.

2-When you are at the Top Level:-
b-When you are at the "top level or at the conceptual level" then you dont have to bother about the details or the 
real functionality of the different objects.

eg:-Forming a car company, then you will think about the basic types of the cars you will be making, 
what features and price bracket and audience will it cater.

3-In abstraction object cannot be made:-
Because we dont have functionalites specified or property values specified.


Technical Points:-
1-Object cannot be made.
2-Abstract class can have concrete property or functionality
3-Concrete class cannot have any abstract property or functionality
4-Children must implement all the abstract members of abstract parent.
