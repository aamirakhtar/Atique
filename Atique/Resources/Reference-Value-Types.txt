In Dot Net we have 2 Types of type systems:-

1-Reference Types (User Define Type):-
	a-All classes
	b-Objects of reference types create on "Heap". Heap is the allocation in RAM for dynamic memory.
	c-Copy by reference.

	eg: string, all user defined classes/types.

2-Value Types (Primitive/Builtin/Value Types):-
	a-All structurs or in c# structs.
	b-instances of value types create on "stack". Stack is the allocation in RAM for static memory.
	c-Copy by Value.

	eg: int, bool, float, double, byte, short, uint, structs.
