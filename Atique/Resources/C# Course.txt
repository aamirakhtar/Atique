C# Course Contents:-

Dot net Framework:-

1-CLR:-
Its a virtual machine component of the dot net framework

Basic CLR elements:-
JIT:-
Pre - JIT
    In Pre-JIT compilation, complete source code is converted into native code in a single cycle (i.e. compiles the entire code into native code in one stretch)
    This is done at the time of application deployment.
Econo - JIT
    In Econo-JIT compilation, the compiler compiles only those methods that are called at run time.
    After execution of this method the compiled methods are removed from memory.
Normal - JIT
    In Normal-JIT compilation, the compiler compiles only those methods that are called at run time.
    After executing this method, compiled methods are stored in a memory cache.
    Now further calls to compiled methods will execute the methods from the memory cache.

	
2-CTS
Common Type System
responsible of managing
Value types.
Reference types.

3-CLS is a subset of CTS:-
Microsoft has defined CLS which are nothing but guidelines that language to follow so that it can communicate with other .NET languages in a seamless manner.

CTS and CLS ensures language interoperability
