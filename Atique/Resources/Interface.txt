Interface:-

Its a specialized form of abstraction/abstract class.
We call it Contract.

Just like contract Both the parties that are classes means, Parent and the child class agree on all methods/properties given in a parent class.

Technically child class must implement all the parent members.

because Interface has all the members abstract by default.

So all the members of the child class implementing/inheriting interface members, must implement that interface members.
